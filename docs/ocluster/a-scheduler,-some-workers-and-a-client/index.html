   <p>In this section we'll look at the infrastructure provided out-of-the-box by OCluster to build a distributed system using Capnp to tie all of the pieces together.</p>
<p>At it's simplest, OCluster provides four main primitives to build a cluster:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduler: the scheduler handles accepting jobs, organising a fair queueing mechanism and dispatching jobs to pools and workers. When it starts up it also generates the <code>admin.cap</code> allowing someone to manage the cluster.
</li>
<li>Worker: a worker belongs to a pool (and will need access to the pool's <code>.cap</code> file, see the previous section) and will process jobs given to it.
</li>
<li>Admin: a service for managing lots of different aspects of the cluster.
</li>
<li>Client: clients can submit jobs to the scheduler, but the admin must first generate a <code>submission.cap</code> and add the client. When submitting jobs the client specifies which pool it wants along with other things like a cache hint. We'll look at these more closely soon.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Above you can see a depiction of a typical OCluster configuration, following the numbers we explain the process of running jobs given this pre-configured setup.</p>
<ol>
<li>A client (one of perhaps many) submits a job to the scheduler providing the required details that a job needs.
</li>
<li>The scheduler implements some form of fair-queuing mechanism as well as ensuring the job will be sent to the right pool.
</li>
<li>A worker in a pool receives a job to run -- the logs are streamed back to the client.
</li>
<li>An administrative client can watch over all of these different aspects.
</li>
</ol>
